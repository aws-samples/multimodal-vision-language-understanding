Rating:0
Reason:the answer can't answer the question because of lack of information.
3. Question:
What is at the front of the bus?
Answer:
Although not explicitly stated, it is typical for city buses to have a front door for boarding and an area for displaying route information or advertisements.
The presence of an advertisement on the back of the bus implies that there is likely a similar display at the front. The bus may also have a front-facing sign or destination board indicating the route and next stop.
Rating:0
